Waiting shed collapsed in earthquake, 2 injured
Two women were wounded in the collapse of a waiting shed after a 4.2 magnitude earthquake in Davao City, around 9:50 in the morning yesterday.
The victims identified by Davao City Police Office (DCPO) Spokesperson Chief Insp. Catherine dela Rey as Maria Teresa Pusta, 43, married and an employee from Bangkal, and Fe Yu, 66, a retired teacher from Buhangin, Davao City, are being treated at the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) for their head injuries.
According to the report of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), the earthquake's origin is tectonic, and the epicenter is on Monte Vista, Compostela Valley with a depth of 62 kilometers.
This is the second time that Mindanao was shooked by an earthuake in Febuary, although the victims of the magnitude 6.7 earthquake in Surigao City, Surigao del Norte last February 10 continue to experience aftershocks.
NO CONNECTION WITH OARFISH
The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) has also denied the public's concern about the number of appearances of snake-looking giant fishes on tha shores of Mindanao—which is believed to be a sign of more earthquakes in Mindanao.
It was reported that an oarfish landed on the shores of Bgy. Masao, Butuan Bay and in the town of Nasipit, both in Agusan del Norte, last November 19, 2017; in the town of Buenavista last Febuary 8; in Tubay last February 13; and in Carmen last February 15.
According to the reports, the people are associating the series of oarfish appearances on the terrible earthquake in Surigao City last February 10.
But according to BFAR, oarfish seldom appears and it only happens when the fish is “about to die due to aging, unavailability of food, and the varying current conditions in surface shallow areas in contrast to its deeper water habitat.”
The Japanese has a strong belief that the appearances of oarfishes are a sign of calamities about to come, like an earthquake.
Exact number of instances unknown, the multiple oarfish appearances on the shores of Japan from December 2009 until March 2010 were associated with the destructive earthquake in Japan which was followed by a huge tsunami last March 2011.

50 killed in a missile attack in Syria
KIEV/BEIRUT (Reuters) — Turkey on Monday accused Russia of an "obvious war crime" after missile attacks in northern Syria killed numbers of people, and warned Kurdish militia fighters there they would face the "harshest reaction" if they tried to capture a town near the Turkish border.
An offensive supported by Russian bombing and Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias has brought the Syrian army to within 25 kilometers of Turkey's border.
The Kurdish YPG militia - which Turkey regards as a hostile insurgent force - has exploited the situation, seizing ground from Syrian rebels to extend its presence along the border.
Almost 50 civilians were killed when missiles hit at least five medical facilities and two schools in rebel-held areas of Syria on Monday, according to the United Nations, which called the attacks a blatant violation of international law.
But Russian Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said Russian air strikes were targeting Islamic State infrastructure and she had no reason to believe that Russian planes had bombed civilian sites in Idlib.

A VERY SAD CHRISTMAS
THE Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) observed no typhoon or low pressure area (LPA) outside the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), so the weather this Christmas will be beautiful.
However, high flood water in six towns in Pampanga will remain until Christmas.
Before this, 43 towns in the province was flooded.
55 towns were also flooded in Bulacan.
Many towns were also flooded in Baler, Aurora.
As a result, some towns there were placed under a state of calamity because of the damage caused by the typhoon.
Some towns in Oriental Mindoro are also under a state of calamity.
But what happened in Central Luzon is noteworthy.
Not only their provinces and towns were flooded.
In fact, almost everything that the typhoon and the rain that came wit it passed by, like Manila and its surrounding areas, was flooded.
But, when the rain stopped and even when the typhoon hadn't yet exited the PAR, the flood already receded except in Bulacan, Pampanga and Nueva Ecija.
The water in these provinces continued to rise.
Up to now, towns in Bulacan and Pampanga are still underwater.
During the storm, there was a landslide in Gabaldon, Nueva Ecija.
The highway in this town was unpassable because it was blocked by ng earth, boulders and timber.
The timber lying acrooss the street are among the few logged trees that remain.
That's why there were no more roots that held the eath and rocks together, which caused rockslide.
That's why the rainwater that fell on the mountain could not be held back.
This is what still continues to pour on some of the lowlands.
And up to now, the water in Nueva Ecija, Pampanga and Bulacan is still rising even if it's a clear day.
The weather is already great.
Even before, it was already great for the people who used their power to enrich themselves from the blessings of nature.
They were the ones who desecrated the trees and other natural resources.
Because of their greed, they only serve their personal interests and in the happiest day of this year, the birthday of the Lord Jesus, the victims of their avarice are those in the evacuation centers who are sad and weeping and their homes that are underwater.
Their Christmas is so sad.

There is no tsunami in the Philippines!
It is unlikely to raise a ‘tsunami alert’ in the Philippines because of the magnitude 7.2 earthquake yesterday in Fiji Island, where a tsunami warning was raised at the Pacific Island Nation.
According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), the public should not be worried about the tsunami in the said island that is part of Melanesia, Oceania, reaching the Philippines.
Based on the historical and tsunami data of Phivolcs, the rise of seawater in Fiji will not reach the country.
In the report of U.S. Geological Survey, the magnitude 7.2 earthquake occurred at 200 kilometers (135 miles) south-west of the tourist hub of Nadi at around five o'clock in the morning (Philippine time).
EDITORIAL - Beware of Zika virus
DENGUE isn't the only disease that the mosquitoes bring, they also cause Zika virus.
And by comparison, the Zika virus has worse effect which has victimized another man here in our country.
Six victims of Zika virus were recorded since it has beedn detected in the country on 2012.
The sixth victim is a 40-year-old woman, married, and from Iloilo.
According to the Department of Health (DOH), the victim was infected by Zika virus when she was bitten by a mosquito in their area.
The woman was tested twice and she resulted positive with Zika virus.
The first case of Zika virus in the country was in 2012 when a 15-year-old boy from Cebu tested positive with the said virus.
He allegedly caught the virus in their area in Cebu.
The carrier of Zika virus is Aedes aegypti, just like dengue.
The symptoms of Zika virus and dengue are also similar, like high fever what lasts a week, the occurence of body rashes, head aches, red eyes, and muscle pain.
The gravest effect of Zika virus is when a carrier mosquito has bitten a pregnant woman.
The baby in her womb would have neurological disorders and brain malformation.
There are a lot of Zika virus cases in Brazil where the newborn babies show an abnormal appearance --- small head and brain damage.
The women in Brazil were warned not to get pregnant yet to avoid infant abnormalities.
Or if you are pregnant, avoid infested areas.
PSN ( Article MRec ), pagematch: 1, sectionmatch:
The DOH continues to remind the people to be ware of Zika virus.
They advised cleanliness with the surroundings so that the mosquitoes won't have any breeding areas.
Cleanliness is the main way to avoid diseased brought by mosquitoes.
Throw empty containers that can hold water to the garbage bins because these these things are were mosquitoes lay their eggs.
Do not leave these Zika virus and dengue carrying mosquitoes a chance to multiply.
THEY GOT THERE ANYWAY
CITIZENS, especially vistims of tropical storms ‘Nona’ and ‘Onyok,’ have long awaited President Aquino's visit to their areas.
In the midst of both shock and joy, they received relief goods from the President; along with a heartfelt message of sympathy for the tragedy they experieced.
The President personally met the disaster victims, who were almost shoulder-to-shoulder in the evacuation centers after the storm destroyed their homes and even their businesses.
Billions of pesos' worth of bridges and roads were destroyed in a large part of Luzon and even in the Visayas.
What we need now is wide-scale rehabilitation, an effort that the administration must ensure.
Despite the concern that the President showed, a few sectors of the nation couldn't help but wonder: Why has he waited this long to meet the typhoon and flood victims?
The answer to this might be rooted on security and the time that should be allotted in the presidential schedule.
When super typhoon ‘Yolanda’ ravaged the nation, the President's visit to the victims did not push through either.
In fact, this was also met with a negative reaction from various sectors.
However, the important thing is that he carried out a humanitarian mission.
I suddenly remembered former President Ramos' style of sympathizing with typhoon and flood victims at the time of his presidency.
He immediately goes to the victims of calamity; he assesses the range of damage through helicopter and other types of vehicles.
He carried out this important mission even in the midst disaster's wrath.
When an area of the National Kidney Transplant Institute (NKTI) burned down, for example, he rushed to the scene to personally learn about the situation.
There are many more incidents that he didn't let pass.
He's a hands-on leader.
The citizens are too soft.
They want the President to always be by their side, assisting them.
Regardless, President Aquino proved that even though the relief goods arrived late, they got there anyway.

Capiz housing, loathed by Yolanda survivors
ROXAS CITY - Three years after the rampage of super typhoon ‘Yolanda’, a P289 million housing project by the government for the typhoon victims in Roxas City, Capiz was deserted after some occupied it.
Not a single Yolanda survivor lives in the 11.87 hectare National Housing Authority (NHA) housing site in Barangay San Jose.
In stead, 187 families who lost their homes to fires last March 2014 were relocated in the area.
Goldenville Realty and Development Corp., the private contractor of NHA for the project, also temporarily suspended the construction in the area.
Roderick Dela Cruz, acting leader of the the families displaced by fires, narrated how a Yolanda survivor went to the area to inspect the housing site and he reportedly told him that none of the typhoon survivors were interested in the free housing.
It was no mystery to Dela Cruz, and said that the tap water in the area is yellowed and sometimes had worms.
He adds, that the children and elderly residents there were frequently sick, apart from having patches on their skins.
He even said, that they themselves shouldered the expenses for installing roofs, windows, doors, and plumbing in the house was because if they didn't the houses were uninhabitable.
In the site visit, the author discovered that the condition of the said housing were as detailed in the report by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)-Region 6 last June 2016 that the Yolanda housing units in Aklan, Antique, Capiz, and Iloilo were incomplete.
This P289 million project had first become controversial for violating the supposed zoning ordinance and the Comprehensive Land Use Plan of the Roxas city government.

Peru marched for women
LIMA, Peru (AP) - Thousands of people marched in Peru's capital last Saturday to protest violence against women and the unfair justice system.
Activists, artists, politicians, and citizens joined on foot to the palace of justice in Lima after a complaint of women's groups against the lax penalty on violators.
President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and first lady Nancy Lange are in solidarity with them.
The march in Peru follows a similar protest in other Latin American countries under the slogan #NiUnaMenos (#NotOneLess).

Magnitude 7.1 earthquake, zero wounded
WELLINGTON (Reuters, AFP) – A powerful 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked New Zealand early Friday, but no wounded or damage were reported.
The earthquake struck 169 km northeast of Gisborne, New Zealand, with depth of 30 km, according to U.S. Geological Survey.
Twitter users in the North Island of the country reported the said quake.
The civil defense ordered the evacuation from some of the coastal areas, particularly in the town of Gisborne, early Friday because of tsunami alert due to the earthquake. However, agencies from other countries said that this is not a big threat.
PREPAREDNESS FOR THE REAL EARTHQUAKE
BECAUSE of the rumpus shaking the Legislature and Judiciary, I suddenly remembered the timely warning of Phivolcs (Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology) regarding the magnitude 7.2 earthquake that might be caused by the movement of the West Valley Fault.
This is in conjuction with Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum's reminder to the public that they should learn from the recent devastation by the magnitude 6.7 earthquake in Surigao del Norte; and should be prepared at all time.
To compare, the earthquake that shook Senate was the to reshuffling of leadership for important committees in the assembly and somewhat firing of senators who are allies of the previous administration.
The judiaciary system was also shook because of the said incident of the alleged uncalled-for arrest of Senador Leila de Lima; allegations that could be filed in the Supreme Court.
Those incidents were clearly stained with politics.
Let's not waste out time on this.
Let's keep in mind Phivolcs's advice to prepare for the huge effect of calamities, especially for ‘The Big One’ we all fear about.
We hope it does not happen, but the agency insinuated that if this happens, thousands will not survive and a lot of buildings and bridges, and many others will be damaged.
We were suprised by the recent death of 8 people after the earthquake in Surigao City.
Aside from this, school buildings, bridges and roads were destroyed.
It is certain that it would take long to rebuild the once progressive city and other towns.
We have already seen this when an ancient church in Bohol was destroyed by an earthquake.
Who would forget the glorious hotel in Baguio City and schools in Nueva Ecija struck by a strong earthquake many years ago?
... It was timely that members of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) held a meeting to lay out the preparations for the magnitude 7.2 earthquake that might hit Metro Manila and whole country anytime.
The movement local government units (LGUs) was highlighted in the meeting, they will handle abrupt rescue to thoose in need of relief assistance.
The preparation also has to evaluate the ‘structural integrity’ or sturdiness of ancient churches in different parts of the country; these structures are at high risk during earthquakes.
Installation of tsunami early-warning devices would also be helpful for coastal towns.
More than anything else, we need to have regular earthquake drills as part of the preparation for ‘The Big One’.

Flood, a type of calamity
Flooding
is one of the most destructive disasters that people must prepare for.
Even the weakest flood causes inconvenience.
It may bring thousands of pesos worth of damages to roads and bridges, buildings, and other economic activities, loss of agricultural crops, and domestic animals.
Flooding can lead to loss of human life, as well as poverty and social livelihood conflicts and hardships in the lives of those affected.
One of its causes is cutting down forest trees (illegal logging).
It is naturally caused by a water phenomenon.
Its arrival is usually brought about by atmospheric events.

DHAKA-30 Bangladeshis were killed, which were mostly women and children and some people were wounded in a stampede yesterday in Gaibandha town, 335 kilometers north of the capital, Dhaka.

State of calamity, to be declared in Boracay
BORACAY ISLAND - A state of calamity can be declared any day in Barangay Manoc Manoc in Boracay Island in Malay, Aklan.
According to Malay Vice Mayor Wilbec Gelito, the Sangguniang Bayan of Malay is only waiting for the final report of the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) to become basis of the declaration.
Based on the initial report of the BFP-Boracay up to P10 million worth of property were consumed by fire on Christmas eve and 10 were reported to be injured.
According to Gelito, the fire lasted for almost four hours because of the firemen's lack of water supply.
Faulty electrical connection is suggested to be the cause of the fire on the island.

tsunami
Tsunámi are consecutive waves with blasts of water usually reaching 100 feet high towards land.
The high wall of water it brings causes widespread destruction once it hits the shore.
This term comes from the Japanese words “tsu” (shore) and “nami” (wave).
The giant tsunami wave comes from a strong quake taking place in the depths of the ocean.
When the plate boundaries on the sea floor have an abrupt fall and rise, the movement of the water over it shifts and waves begin to roll and turn into a tsunami.
A tsunami can reach a speed of up to 500 miles per hour.
The water dramatically recedes from the shore temporarily exposing the previously submerged part of the sea and it will be followed by a giant raging wave that hits the land.
Most tsunamis occur within the so-called “Pacific Ring of Fire,” a geologically active area with tectonic movements in the earth that causes earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
A tsunami may also come from landslides and volcanic erruptions happening in the depths of the ocean.
Japan has the most recorded incidents of tsunami across the world.
But the tsunami that happened in 2004 from the Indian Ocean was one of the grimmest calamities in the history of the world, reaching over 230,000 casualties from 14 countries surrounding the Indian Ocean.
Last March 11, 2011, there was a tremendous earthquake coming from the sea within Japanese territory, in Oshika Peninsula in the Tohoku region.
This earthquake was one of the strongest ever recorded in Japan and the fifth strongest in the history of the world.
It brought a tsunami that reached 133 feet high and killed 15,841 Japanese citizens.
According to Japanese officials, this is the heaviest crisis that struck their nation that left such a severe damage to Japanese life and livelihood.

EDITORIAL: Advocate peace!
All the recent unrest throughout the world has been disheartening.
So many lives are lost because of differences in ideology and religion.
Lots of citizens are fleeing from their only home and country just to preserve their lives.
Refugees without sanctuary.
People putting their faith in traveling overseas, many of them not fortunate enough to reach safety.
It's even more disheartening that not all countries receive them with open arms.
Until now, while many nations like ours are busy with the Christmas season and with welcoming the new year, those driven away from their homes by war still have no roofs over their heads where they can celebrate these occassions.
Some of them might not celebrate Christmas because of having a different religion, but the transition into the new year is celebrated by all, regardless of race and religion.
We're truly fortunate because this kind of chaos does not occur in our country.
There are no suicide bombers or wars brought about by ISIS and Muslim extremists.
If ever there is any part of Mindanao stained by this kind of violence, our armed forces make sure that the situation is under control.
To put it simply, we're not biting our nails about hundreds of explosions or savage encounters of bullets and mortar.
We're not awakened from sleep by air strikes.
I hope we learn to be thankful for this great blessing.
But as children of our God Almighty who has love for His neighbor, it's our duty to be instruments of peace, not only this Christmas and in our own nation, but in all instances and for anyone.
Using social media, we can spread peace and love, not only to our fellow countrymen, but also to other peoples, especially to those who are victims of war in their own country.
If we can't do anything else for them, prayer is invaluable for their safety, and for their nation's peace.
Soccer stadium in Iraq, bombed: 29 dead, 60 injured
BAGHDAD (AP) - A suicide bomber blew up a soccer stadium last Friday, killing 29 people and 60 more were injured, officials confirmed.
The explosion took place in the heat of a soccer match in the city of Iskanderiyah, 30 miles (50 kilometers) from Baghdad, according to officials.
Medical officials confirmed the number of casualties.
Officials talk privately about the incident because they are not authorized to give a statement to journalists.
The Islamic State (IS) claim responsibility over the attack on their online statement, reports SITE intelligence group, a monitoring organization.
This happened after Iraqi military spokesman Yahya Rusoul's statement that the Iraqi troops and the Sunni tribal fighters have reclaimed the town of Kubeisa in the province of Anbar from the IS.
Prior to this, the IS was driven off to the villages in the province of Nineveh by intense coalition airstrikes.
According to analysts and coalition officials, they expect that while the group is losing the battles they will heighten their attacks in Iraq and in other parts of the world.
It may be recalled that IS also took responsibility for the consecutive bombings last Tuesday in Brussels, which killed 30 people while around 300 were injured.
Father shot in front of children
The murder of a man who was shot in front of his two children in Baranggay Sto. Cristo, Quezon City two days ago is now viral on social media.
It can be seen on the closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera video that before the shooting happened, two boys jumped in on the back seat of a white Toyota Innova while it was parked on the intersection of Palawan and Pangasinan Street.
A few seconds after, a man wearing a red t-shirt, shorts, and cap while carrying a gun appeared and approached the victim on the driver’s seat, identified as Ricky Leang, and gunned him down.
Before escaping, the yet identified man took the victim's wallet.
After the shooting, Leang's two sons rushed out of the car and asked for help at a sari-sari store.
Leang was rushed to Quezon City General Hospital (QCGH) but he still passed away.

50,000 villagers in flooded India refuse to leave
PATNA, India 2008-09-08 00:16:51 UTC
At least 50,000 people in India have refused to abandon their homes in flood-ravaged northern Indian despite pleas by authorities to evacuate.
Newspaper advertisements also urged thousands of flood survivors Sunday to go to one of 77 state-run camps set up in Saharsa district in impoverished Bihar state, where clean drinking water, food and medical care was available.
At least 50,000 people have refused to leave their homes in the district, one of the worst-affected areas in Bihar, said Prataya Amrit, a state disaster management official.
Towns and villages in the flooded area are home to about 1.2 million people.
Rescue workers have evacuated about 900,000 villagers, but with river levels falling by up to two feet (0.6 meter) over the last few days, thousands began to return to their homes, Amrit said.
The Kosi River, which flows down from the Himalayas in neighboring Nepal into India where it joins the Ganges River, burst its banks Aug. 18 and dramatically shifted course, moving dozens of miles (kilometers) to the east.
It turned hundreds of square miles (kilometers) of land in Bihar into a giant lake.
On Saturday, government engineers began digging a new channel to correct the course of the river and plug the mile- (1.7-kilometer) long breach in the embankment.
Disaster officials have not said when it would be safe for villagers to return, and displaced residents may have to remain in camps for several months.
Most areas will likely remain flooded until monsoon rains taper off in November, officials say.
The government has set up more than 250 relief camps throughout the inundated region and rushed about 900 doctors and medical supplies there.
Already hundreds of cases of pneumonia, diarrhea and high fevers have been reported.
Doctors started immunization drives Saturday in the shelters to counter fears that waterborne diseases will spread as the number of camp residents grow.
Authorities have only confirmed 38 deaths, but it is widely believed the final toll will be much higher.
In neighboring Bangladesh, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center in its latest bulletin Sunday said most major rivers were flowing above the danger mark and floodwaters were only likely to start receding by the end of next week.
The government gave no details about the number of people killed in Bangladesh, but news reports have said at least 19 people have died over the last two weeks.
The monsoon season, which runs from June to September, brings rain vital for the farmers of South Asia but also can cause massive destruction.
Moderate earthquake hits Sukabumi, Indonesia
JAKARTA, Oct. 27
An earthquake measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale shook Sukabumi, West Java province of Indonesia, on Monday, but there was no reports of casualties and material losses, the Meteorological and Geophysics Agency (BMG) said.
The epicenter of earthquake, which occurred at 4:12 a.m. local time (2112 GMT Sunday), was located at 7.87 degrees south latitude and 107.23 degrees east longitude, at a depth of 12 km below sea level, around 111 km southeast of Sukabumi, and 13 km southwest of Bandung, West Java.
Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago, sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire," the edge of a tectonic plate which is prone to seismic upheaval.
The summit is coinciding with more unrest in several areas of the West Bank and Gaza strip.
Hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians stormed the Israeli-controlled section of Hebron, breaking a curfew imposed since the outbreak of the unrest last month.
Witnesses said Israeli soldiers fired live ammunition and rubber-coated metal bullets, wounding at least seven people.
Thousands of Palestinian demonstrators marched in the area to protest against a renewal of contacts with Israel.
Landslide, floods kill about 80 in central and southern Philippines
MANILA, Philippines
Landslides and floods killed about 80 people in the southern and central Philippines following several days of rains, officials said Saturday.
Health officials in Southern Leyte province in the central Philippines reported that landslides during heavy rains late Friday killed 50 people in San Francisco town and 20 in Liloan town, said Gov. Rosette Lerias.
``There are landslides all over the province,'' she said, adding that 80 houses were reported buried in the San Francisco landslides.
``It has been raining for several days and the ground has become so saturated.
'' Allen Olayvar, coordinator of the Office of Civil Defense in Southern Leyte, said provincial officials received cell phone text messages early Saturday reporting the casualties.
``Emergency!
'' one text message said.
``There are so many dead from landslide here ... Please inform the governor to get help here.
There are no medicines at the (Regional Health Unit).
'' Lorene Sia, duty officer at the regional civil defense office in Butuan city on the southern island of Mindanao, said nine people, including two infants and a 5-year-old girl, were killed in separate landslides in Surigao city.
No other details were immediately available.
Roads to San Francisco were blocked by landslides, and disaster officers planned to go to the town by boat later Saturday to investigate the casualty reports there, Olayvar said.
Several buses bound for a port in Liloan have also been stranded, he added.
The rains began to pour Monday over eastern parts of the central Philippines and Mindanao.
A former US Army sergeant has pleaded guilty in New York to conspiracy in the bombings of American Embassies in east Africa in 1998.
Ali Mohammed, a native of Egypt, has admitted to five charges of conspiring with a Saudi born dissident Osama bin Laden to attack US targets in the Middle-East.
More than 220 people died in the blasts.
The nuclear submarine "Kursk" could become a permanent underwater grave for 118 Russian sailors.
Russia's top admiral says he may scrap efforts to recover the bodies if experts decide the mission would endanger deep sea divers.
All those aboard the "Kursk" were killed in August when the sub sank after being damaged by an explosion in the Barents Sea.
The cause of the disaster has not been determined.
An international salvage team is due to arrive at the scene of the accident tomorrow.
At least 33 dead in Rajasthan floods
NEW DELHI, Aug. 22
The death toll in Rajasthan's floods touched 33 as five more persons were swept away in the past 48 hours in the desert state where nine districts are facing the fury of the monsoon rains.
The situation continues to be bad in Udaipur, Dungarpur, Barmer, Pali, Sirohi, Jalore, Kota and Jhalawar districts.
Over 1,500 villages and towns spread in these districts continue to be submerged.
The relief operations were also hampered in some places due to the continuous rains.
Electricity and telephone networks have been disrupted in all the flood-affected areas and widespread flooding has affected the road and rail traffic network.
Schools and colleges in the city of lakes -- Udaipur -- have been indefinitely closed.
Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje said that the situation is still grim in the flood-affected areas.
"The flood situation is improving slowly with less water flowing into the dams, from where water is constantly being discharged," Indo-Asian News Service quoted the chief minister as saying.
Raje said that assessment of loss due to floods would be done soon, and a memorandum would be sent to the Indian government seeking assistance for rehabilitation and relief operations.
Indian army continued relief operations in the flood-affected areas of the state and their helicopters dropped food packets in affected areas.
5.0 magnitude earthquake hits Solomon Islands 5.0 magnitude earthquake hits Solomon Islands
WELLINGTON, Dec. 18
An earthquake measuring 5.0 on the Richter scale hit the South Pacific nation of Solomon Islands on Thursday, and there were no reports of casualties or damage.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake occurred at 07:22 p.m. New Zealand local time (06:22 GMT) and the epicenter was 455 km northwest of Honiara at a depth of 145.5 km.
Earlier in the day, an earthquake measuring 5.3 on the Richter scale also hit the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu, causing no casualties or damages.
The quake occurred at 04:20 p.m. New Zealand local time (03:20 GMT) and the epic center was 90 km northeast of Port-Vila and at a depth of 258.5 km.

The following a grim story out of Russia tonight where there's proof some of the sailors on board that Russian nuclear submarine the Kursk initially survived the explosion that sank the sub, only to be trapped later.
One of the sailors wrote a letter during those terrible final hours.
Today, 10 weeks after a mysterious accident sent the Kursk to the bottom of the Barents sea, a grisly discovery.
In the pocket of one of the crew, a handwritten note, dying words of a sailor trapped alive in the sunken sub.
He is this lieutenant captain, seen here three years ago aboard the Kursk.
His last words tell a chilling tail -- tale of a desperate but future ill attempt to escape.
It now appears 23 survived -- survived the initial explosion.
The 23 frantically scrambled to the rear of the sub.
They find the escape hatch flooded and seal themselves in compartment nine.
Realizing he will die, he begins to write.
He addressed the letter to his wife, Olga.
He is my dear, dear beloved.
I want to see him again, read his letter.
The chilling account raises new questions and criticisms of the Russian navy, which waited several days before attempting to launch any rescue mission
But navy officials here at the Pentagon say any rescue attempt would have failed, that there really was no hope for the 23 survivors.
It's believed they would have frozen to death in hours, long before they ran out of air.
That may be little consolation for the families.

Mexico: 7.8 Magnitude Earthquake Rattles the Country On March 20, 2012, around midday, an earthquake hit the south and central part of Mexico.
The quake was felt more intensively in the states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Morelos and Mexico City.
According to the Mexican National Seismological Service (@SimsologicoMx) [es] the earthquake presented the following characteristics:
SISMO 7.8 Richter 29 km al SUR de OMETEPEC, GRO 20/03/12 12:02:50 Lat 16.42 Lon -98.36 Pf 15 km
In some areas of Mexico City people panicked as citizens waited on the streets to go back to their offices.
Since there were power outages in some neighborhoods, people turned to the Internet to contact family members and report the situation on the ground.
Jazmin Fajardo (@jazminfajardo) [es], for example, said:
In La Condesa (a neighborhood close to downtown Mexico City) everybody is outside the buildings, dust and gas smell Nayeli Roldán (@nayaroldan) [es] reported that some took refuge at the Zocalo (the square that sits at the heart of Mexico City) of Mexico's capital city:
People emptying buildings near the Zocalo User RankiaoRecordsHD shared the following video of the earthquake on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXBJl5HbY38&feature=related Juliana Rincón gathered more citizen videos of the quake at a post for Global Voices.
Amidst the panic, the Twitter account of Walmart Mexico (@WalmartComMx) published:

@WalmartComMx Borra su tweet pero aqui el print de pantalla #tembor #temblorDF #temblorMexico http://twitpic.com/8z1f55
@WalmartComMx erases its tweet but here's the screenshot #tembor #temblorDF #temblorMexico http://twitpic.com/8z1f55 The deed generated outrage among the Twitter community who strongly condemned it using the hashtag #OfertasWalmart (Walmart Sales) In the state of Oaxaca, in southern Mexico, 25 municipalities reported damages [es], and in the state of Guerrero 800 houses [es] were counted as ruined.
Meanwhile in the state of Morelos a church suffered [es] severe destruction.
Despite those damages and some power cuts in Mexico City, the aftermath of the earthquake was significantly less than the disastrous quake of September 19, 1985, after which there were several and serious actions to improve the country's preparation for such events.
The efforts seem to have paid off since no casualties have been reported up to the moment this post was published.

PAF plane, crashed; 2 pilots, wounded
A two-seater plane of the Philippine Air Force crashed at a small island near Zamboanga City yesterday and it was a miracle that the two pilots survived the incident.
They're safe. The pilots were forced to bail out after encountering a problem of undetermined cause. We are trying to retrieve the plane to determine what exactly happened, said Padilla.
According to Army officials in Zamboanga, the airplane crashed in the southern portion of Santa Cruz, 2.5 nautical miles from Zamboanga City, yesterday at about 10:52 in the morning.
They were already going back to Edwin Andrews Airbase in the city when they crashed. The said aircraft is part of two aircraft teams intended to help the Philippine Coast Guard in searching for a commercial vessel which left the Zamboanga port without proper clearances.
At the time this story was written, the two pilots who were scheduled to go to the Southern Command Headquarters with the rescue team of the 5th Marine Company are still unidentified.
Meanwhile, Padilla denied that rebels are connected to this incident.

Uganda: Nodding Disease Denying Children Their Future
Nodding disease is a mentally and physically disabling disease that affects children between 1 and 10 years.
It is currently restricted to small regions in South Sudan, Tanzania and northern Uganda.
The disease is incurable at the moment and its cause is not known.
Recently, some old people have also shown signs of the disease.
The areas affected by the disease are mainly in the northern region of the country.
The disease denies the children a chance to be productive as they cannot do anything for themselves, be it holding a knife to make a meal for the girls, and holding a hoe to plant a single seed for the boys. An 18 year old man may look like a 3 year old boy and has to be carried around and held to get some heat in the body.
The first symptoms of this disease is the continuous nodding of the head, failure to eat and drink.
Later on the child becomes stunted physically and mentally.
A Ugandan journalist, Florence Naluyimba, has taken the first initiative to investigate and bring the issue to light.
She says although the government is trying to provide medicine to help the victims in 3 health centers, they have to travel long distances on foot or on bicycles to reach the health centers.
The sick ones cannot take themselves to the hospitals and have to be carried on the back or put on bicycles for over 30km. The disease usually leads to seizures and at times this makes them fall into fire, sharp objects or in ponds/rivers, leading to death or severe injuries.
Many children have lost body parts such as fingers in these accidents.
The Center for Disease Control plans to carry out aerial spraying targeting black flies, which are suspected to be the major cause of this illness.
It is not clear whether this will help or not.
Ugandan villagers complain that samples were taken to USA since 2010, but they have never received any reliable information about the cure and cause since that time.
Below are some pictures and YouTube videos about the disease.
Nodding disease in its initial stages.

Year-end Report
Threat of terrorism in 2002
by JOEL SAN JUAN and JEFFERSON ANTIPORDA
BETTERMENT of skills in pursuing local terrorist groups like the Abu Sayyaf and the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army was the response of the police and the military after the September 11 terror attack in the United States in 2001 until 2002.
Joint Military Exercises
The US and the Philippines agreed to conduct the RP-US military exercise in Zamboanga and Basilan from Luzon.
Manila and Washington made and approved a TOR before the start of the war games last February 1, which required the US military to "help, observe and train" their Filipino counterpart.
Guingo resigned last July because of policy differences with the President including the newly signed Mutual Logistics Support Agreement about which it was reported that the Vice President was bypassed.
Last February 1, the number of American soldiers reached 1,000 who arrived to participate in the training exercises Noong Pebrero 1, which were successful until one US MH-47E Chinook helicopter crashed at Zamboanga Point in Negros Oriental and caused the death of 10 US personnel aboard the aircraft.
Oplan Daybreak and Oplan Endgame
In the middle of the war games, the Philippine Military launched Oplan Daybreak, a rescue operation for the Burnham couple and the nurse, Ediborah Yap, in the border of Sarawai and Sibuco, towns of Zamboanga del Norte last June 7.
The operation resulted in the death of Martin and Yap while Gracia was shot in her left leg. After a few days at the hospital, Gracia went home to her family in Wichita, Kansas.
Two weeks after Gracia's rescue and recovery of the remains of Yap and Martin, Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abu Sabaya was killed in an encounter with the Philippine Navy while trying to escape aboard a motor boat at Sibuco, Zamboanga del Norte.
Following the news of Sabaya's death, President Macapagal-Arroyo designated the AFP to go after the leader of the group thus the launching of Oplan Endgame.
Kidnapping/ bombing
The AFP's campaign to paralyse the groups in the country was impedded by the kidnapping of the three Indonesian crewmen, Muntu Winowata, Pieter Lerrech and one Julkipli by pirates on June 17.
In August, Abu Sayyaf abducted six Jehova's Witnesses Christian evangelists.
Two men were beheaded while Nori Bendijo, Flor Montolo, Cleofe Montolo and Amilyn Mantic are still in the hands of the Abu Sayyaf, which is led by Radulan Sahiron.
Meanwhile, several series of bombings shocked the South and Manila in October, which killed 20 people including an American soldier. The number of people injured in the incident reached 200.
Authorities blamed the Abu Sayyaf at the same time involving the Jemaah Islamiyah, which is the main arm of the al-Qaida in Southeast Asia.
Aside from the capture of Fathur Rohman al-Ghozi, there is still no sufficient information about the operation of Jemaah, according to former AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Benjamin Defensor.
Al-Ghozi, who is a member of Jemaah Islamiyah, admitted to his involvement in the bombing of a Light Rail Transit station on December 30, 2001.
Because of the threat of terrorism in the whole world, Gen. Hermogenes Ebdane Jr. was appointed as new chief of the Philippine National Police.
Captured
The AFP and PNP also captured Adbulmukum Edris, alias Mukim Edris, a few days before Defensor left his position as AFP chief on November 28.
Edris, reported to be an al-Qaida trained Abu Sayyaf leader and holding a a "master plan" to carry out the bombing in Metro Manila through car bombs, was captured by the Philippine Air Force and police intelligence.
Several suspected terrorists, Abduljamin Asanul Habi, Bas Ismael, Madznul Abdula Ladja and Buyungan Bungkak, were arrested because of a series of bombings in Zamboanga particularly the three consecutive incidents - the Malagutay bombing on October 2, the twin explosions at the Shop-o-rama and Shoppers Central last October 17, and bombing of Fort del Pilar last October 20.
Agus Dwikarna was also captured and was sentenced by Judge Henrick Gingoyon of the Pasay City regional Trial Court.
July 21, in a raid at their safehouse at Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao, Abdubasit Usman and Mahammad Nur Umog were arrested because of the Fitmart shopping mall bombing where 15 people were killed and 54 others were wounded in the April 21 blast.
CPP-NPA, terrorists
Because of the expanded campaign against terrorism, the CPP-NPA were included in the blacklist of the European Union and the United States.
Even then, Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Eduardo Ermita declared that security officials are making a draft of a peace agreement that may become terms of reference for future peace talks in the National Democratic Front, political arm of the CPP-NPA.
Netherland-based CPP founding chairman Jose Maria Sison stood his ground and warned of retaliation. According to Chief Supt. Robert Delfin, police director for intelligence, from 25,000 members in 1987, the number of NPA has decreased to 10,000.
Ledesma kidnapper identified by PNP
by
JOHN ANTHONY CONCEPCION
The Philippine National Police (PNP) has IDENTIFIED the syndicate behind the kidnapping syndicate responsible for the abduction of the two children of Negros Occidental Rep. Jules Ledesma. It was revealed by C/Supt. Eduardo Matillano, newly appointed director of the PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), that this syndicate is not new, contrary to newspaper reports. According to him, this is one of the 16 remaining kidnapping syndicates that is in the "order of battle" (OB) of the PNP.
But Matillano refused to name the syndicate or mention their past victims so it will not disturb the current operation against the suspects.
He is leaving it to the Police Anti-Crime and Emergency Response (PACER) to reveal the details of the manhunt operation.
Cristina Julieta Victoria, 10, and Carlo Julio Thomas, five years old were abducted last September 13 in San Juan while on their way to school and released on Tuesday, September 17, in Makati City.
PACER officials did not want to give a statement because they did not want to disturb the operation.
That is what we (police) really want understanding and patience from the citizenry. Your PNP is at work here, let us help them by giving more understanding and patience, according to Bataoil.

Heroism in the air
by LEA MANTO-BELTRAN
(Last part)
(Previously: Copilot Lt. Felix Gaston of the Philippine Airlines related how 50 years ago on December 30, 1952, the world's very first air hijacking occurred. He recalled how Capt. Pedro Perlas and flight steward Eduardo Diago of Flight C-38, a Douglas DC-3, were killed beside him by a desperate Ang Chio Kio who was wanted by the police then because of the murder of 16-year old Socorro Lim.)
Destination: Amoy
The Philippines did not yet know about the Communist government newly established by Chairman Mao Zedong five years earlier.
The military exiled the Nationalists led by Chiang Kai-shek to Formosa (now Taiwan), which was proclaimed Republic of China in 1950.
During that time, China and Taiwan were still at odds, which started in 1930 and any incursion of an aircraft from a nation allied with Taiwan was bound to be mistaken for enemy.
That means, Gaston, who was then a military officer, may be arrested. He was only sent by the air force to PAL for
a temporary tour of duty for a training on how to fly an airplane.
Promise
Gaston had almost lost hope but when he thought of the six scared passengers and his wife, Dolores Rastrollo-Gaston who was then pregnant with their first child, he mustered enough courage.
On the way to Amoy, Gaston made Ang promise that he will protect him and his passengers upon arrival in mainland China. He told him (Ang) to promise in the name of his ancestors but Ang promised in the name of the gun he was carrying.
Following
With the help of what little knowledge he had and a pocket-sized illustration of Asia that he found in the geography book that Ang gave him, Gaston went on to fly the plane when he sensed there were two airplanes with Chinese Nationalist marking following him.
With two dead people aboard, one hijacker and 6 scared passengers, Gaston did not know whether the marking was friendly or dangerous.
He swayed the DC-3's wing, which means 'friendly' in aviation language and that he wanted to land. The problem was, Ang would not agree to it.
He felt a mixture of anger and fear and he wanted to lunge at Ang but he saw the man put a new magazine on his gun that warned of his determination to kill. He could not do anything but to follow Ang, which prompted the two planes to fire at the DC-3 he was flying.
It was a miracle that he was not hit. He flew the plane and convinced Ang to find a Nationalist plane to help them land because they were running out of fuel.
Help
They flew in circle once more and saw two T6 that were after them and gave a friendly signal.
They were given permission to follow the Taiwanese plane to Quemoy, the last Nationalist camp near mainland China.
Quemoy is just one port away from Amoy. According to Gaston, the distance is equal to the distance from Manila to Sangley Point, Cavite.
For Gaston and the passengers, their fate changed here. They were met by hundreds of Nationalist soldiers bearing bayonets and ready to attack anytime.
Ang talked to authorities and Gaston explained what really happened. Ang was kept away from them and after two days they were brought back to Manila aboard a PI-C38 with the remains of the two dead passengers.
Miracle
"When I think back to the whole incident, I become more convinced that a miracle happened for all of us."
Before proceding to Manila from Laoag, Gaston requested to refuel because he noticed a change in the weather for the worse and they might run out of fuel. According to him, if they had not done that, they might not have been able to land safely on the ground.
Another one of his secrets - his training in the Air Force to be cool and always have a plan so that each step is assured.
During the 50th year of the incident, Gaston requested to once again meet the passengers of C-38 and the Taiwanese pilots of the T6 who helped them to safety.
Heroism
Though it was a frightening experience for a young pilot, this did not dampen his desire to fly so that he went on to become a pilot and stayed as a pilot for PAL for a long time.
Fragrant place to visit in Morocco
by
Liam Chantal Duzon
MARRAKESH MOROCCO -Very beautiful and really amazing are the descriptions of the Koutoubiya Minaret of Morocco, a tower built during the 11th century.
Whoever visit here would be thinking that this 220 feet tower is surrounded by enchantment because of its very fragrant smell.
Aside from the amazing architecture of Koutoubiya Minaret, the foreigners visiting here could not avoid to ask the source of the very fragrant smell of the place.
Others are suspecting that the fragrance coming from the its walls is a kind of presence manifested by the enchanted beings who are the real owners and residents of Minaret.
But according to historians, the fragrance of Minaret is not coming from the enchanted beings but from the real and funny story behind its construction.
According to them, the Hispanic-Moorish masterpiece of Morocco was built in the year 1195 after Sultan Yakub al Mansur defeated Alphonso III, a Castilian King during their fight in Alarcos in Spain.
As a sign of gratitude to Mohammed, Yakub ordered the construction of a mosque in Marrakesh.
Because the mosque is dedicated to someone great, it should only be appropriate to use special materials in the construction. That's why Yakub thought of mixing 960 sacks of perfume in the cement and sand used by the workers in building the mosque.
The great amount of perfume mixed was the reason why one could still smell the fragrance coming from its walls until now.
Koutoubiya is the highest building in Morocco but for six centuries, only Muslim priests could go up to the top of the tower where one could see the whole beauty of Marrakesh!
No sex for German soldiers
BERLIN-Germans who would like to join the army might think twice, thanks to the new regulation prohibiting soldiers to have sex while in active service.
Instructed by the Defense Ministry in a decree, it is prohibited for a soldier to have sex with another soldier in any gender or with their partner because this would decrease the "morale" and a threat to "mutual trust and soldiers' willingness to help each other."
This was first raised by the army in the series of proposal for women soldiers when they were accepted in active service since 1001.
"Women soldiers will also have to take down their favorite pin-ups, as one clause, expressly formulated to include both men and women, prohibits them from hanging up pornographic images that might offend others," according to an official.
Qatar: Deadly Blaze in Shopping Mall On May 28, 2012, a fire broke out at Doha's Villaggio Mall, leaving 19 dead, 13 of whom were children.
Another 17 were injured.
The children were trapped in a nursery within the mall, and they and four teachers died of smoke inhalation. Two firefighters died as they attempted to rescue them.
Those who died came from various countries including France, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Africa and Spain.
What happened?
Qatar's Ministry of Interior reported:
@MOI_QatarEn : The Minister said that the Rescue Police reached the spot within a minute of information and Civil Defence team reached after two minutes.
@MOI_QatarEn : But lack of floor plans, thick smoke and heat and malfunctioning sprinkler systems hindered rescue efforts at the Villaggio.
@MOI_QatarEn : It was alerted lately only that children were trapped inside and finally Firefighters had to go in through the ceiling.

Today may well be remembered as one of Doha's darkest.
For those who have announced to friends and family that Doha is a wonderfully safe place to raise our children, today will perhaps be remembered as the day that innocence was lost.
Where exactly the fire began is yet to be confirmed.
The nursery was in the interior of the mall, meaning you walked through a virtual rabbit warren of corridors to get there.
From what I understand, when the firefighters arrived at those corridors they were considered impenetrable and too dangerous to enter, it was decided the only other way to get there, was through the ceiling.
By the time the hole was cut, it was too late, they were gone.
Thirteen beautiful children, four teachers and two firefighters.
Smoke inhalation meant that their little bodies were carried lifeless from the building.
In this video journalism student Usama Alony ( usamaah2290 ) interviewed witnesses and filmed rescue efforts (he notes that some viewers might find it upsetting):
What about safety requirements?
Witnesses reported that there were neither alarms nor sprinklers in operation at Villaggio Mall.
Nano expressed his surprise:
The following video by TheVanishforever features an interview with a restaurant employee, in which she says that in the four years she had worked in Villaggio she couldn't recall any fire drill or training: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kRQ2bLtsTg Where were the local media?
Doha residents were furious that local media seemed to be ignoring the fire, and were not providing updates.
South African Bilal Randeree criticized the absence of coverage on local radio:
@halalcomedy : Stuck in traffic cos of the #Villagio fire and forced to listen to #QBSradio talk cheating husbands kissing mistresses!
#occupyqbs
From Libya, Hamid asked about the Qatari network Al Jazeera:
@2011feb17 : Oh dear, with the thousands of reporters Aljazeera have around the world they forgot to appoint one in Doha?
#VillaggioFire news blackout!
Al Jazeera English online producer Ben Piven gave credit, like many others, to the blog Doha News for its coverage :
@benpiven : @dohanews only source with real info on #VillaggioFire. Huge lack of local media coverage after public safety failure in massive mall blaze.
Qatar newspaper The Peninsula acknowledged the role of citizen media played in reporting the fire in an article entitled “New media trumps the traditional”.
Mourning the dead as #OneCommunityDoha‬ There are plans for a public gathering at Aspire Park in Doha on May 29 to support the families who lost loved ones in the Villaggio fire.
While those who died were all foreign residents of Qatar, Qataris have been quick to offer their support.
Twitter user Qataria78 tweeted:
@Qataria78 : Good morning, a day has passed but ur always on our minds, Mothers we feel the pain ur going through :( ‪#villaggio‬ #‪#VillaggioFire

Greek Anarchists’ Anti-Racism Demonstration in Photos
This post is part of our special coverage Europe in Crisis. On Saturday September 1, 2012, an anti-racism demonstration took place in central Athens, Greece, with Monastiraki Square as the starting point.
Hundreds of demonstrators, mainly anarchists, gathered to protest against recent events such as violent, even lethal, attacks against immi grants [el] by members of extremist right-wing group Golden Dawn, the pillory of HIV-positive prostitutes by police, and the government stop-and-search campaign ‘Xenios Zeus’ [mainly targeting people of colour for their identification papers].
Demonstrators gathered in Monastiraki.

Demonstrators advanced to Omonoia Square via Athinas Street and ended up in Monastiraki again.
Riot police prevented them from continuing through Panepistimiou Street [which leads to the Greek Parliament], however no further incidents took place, except some minor verbal disputes between some demonstrators and police officers.

Greek society is gradually realizing that racism is a threat and must be confronted.

Bush: Iraqi threat to US, intensifies
CINCINNATI-US President George W. Bush said last Monday that the arms threat of Iraq "only grows worse with time" and warned the Iraqi generals not to follow any "cruel and desperate orders" from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and if not, they will face the war crimes tribunal.
In his speech on the Iraq issue, Bush mentioned that Saddam is a "murderous tyrant" with intense anger with the United States and said that Baghdad needs to bring out its weapons of mass destruction and needs to destroy them.
"Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are controlled by a murderous tyrant, who has already used chemical weapons to kill thousands of people," stated by Bush. "The danger is already significant, and it only grows worse with time."
Although he said that war eruption may not be avoided, he warns the Iraqi officers, by saying: An Iraqi regime faced with its own demise may attempt cruel and desperate measures. If Saddam Hussein orders such measures, his generals would be well advised to refuse those orders.
"If they do not refuse, they must understand that all war criminals will be pursued and punished," he said.
Regarding this, US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said that the United States is ready to make war with Iraq, whatever its consequence.
According to him, the importance of the impendent war is more important for freedom, and will not be equaled by any amount.
"If the president does decide that we need to take military action, I'll say this to you about the cost - whatever it is we can afford it," he said during his speech at Houston Forum.
"The short answer (to questions about cost) is 'freedom is priceless.'"
O'Neill spoke after they watched President Bush's from Cincinnati, Ohio. It is related to the warning of Bush to Saddam to wage war if he will not agree to disarmament.
At the same time, treasury secretary is optimistic about the condition of US economy in the future, and repeat the prediction that there will be a 3 percent growth of the economy, but he pointed out that at present it is not doing quite well.

Filipinos in 'diaspora'
THE word "diaspora" is used for Hebrews living outside of Israel or if not those who are spread over various places all over the world and enduring oppression just to live. We are also familiar with the "wandering Jew" in most of Europe and America. The same with the history of the Chinese who are also spreading all over the world. And like foreigners who are not living in their own countries, these "people in diaspora" are always the first victims of cruelty and discrimination.
And it seems that this is how we treat the more or less six million Filipinos that are now spreading all over the world. Last 1988, I went to Abu Dhabi and arrived at as distant poultry farm in the middle of the desert, which only has Arabs and camels. It was such a big surprise that I heard a Filipino swearing! Even at the navel of the desert there is a Filipino!
In other words, the Filipino is now global because it is present in almost all countries of the world. This is because Filipinos are excellent in various skills, aside from being good English speakers which is the reason why he or she is always selected by employers in hospitals and the telecommunications industry, and even as caretakers of the sick or as baby sitters. And this is how Filipinos become the top dollar-earners for our country.
However, since Filipinos have become "global", they also become involved in global movements. For example the effects of the war between the US and Iraq is sure echo all over Europe. According to the groups of Gen. Cimatu, the Filipino is more afraid of losing his job than being hit by a bullet in war.
During the last Gulf War, not all Filipinos went home, as lot of DHs went with their employers in evacuating from Kuwait to U.A.E. The same thing happened with the Filipinos in Saudi. The whites went home in fear of the war. However, the Filipinos remained in Saudi to take care of the places left by the whites.
They are also gradually dismissing Filipina DHs because Chinese women from Mainland China, need the job. This is the reason why renewal of contracts are frequently not done after they have expired. This is also happening in Europe. For example, it seems that in Italy the standard pay of Filipinas and Filipino DHs are already too high according to the dictates of the economy. Well, they can always get other people for smaller salaries like the Thailanders, Indonesians, Pakistanis and Bombays.
The consequence of the global econimic crisis may be the reason why various countries have united in letting Filipinos go back home. What hurts the most is that a more serious economic crisis awaits us if all of them go home because we could not find any jobs for them here. This will be a big shock to our country because we are not prepared for this. This is always the case anyway, we always lack preparation.
TO THE ALLEGATION OF RUBOUT
It was a shootout-PNP
by
JOHN ANTHONY CONCEPCION
The Philippine National Police yesterday sternly denied the allegation of former Narcotics agent Mary "Rosebud" Ong that the shootout in Cavite between members of the Police Anti-Crime and Emergency Response (PACER) and three members of the Patinio-Mostrales kidnapping syndicate was a rubout.
Leopoldo Bataoil, the said operation was legitimate where the suspects, who were also involved in the murder of Young Officers Union (YOU) self-proclaimed spokesman Baron Cervantes, were killed while escaping to their safe house, which is in Barangay Manggahan, Gen. Trias in Cavite, around 4:25 in the morning the other day.
The PACER operatives and members of the Cavite Provincial Police Office (PPO) killed in the alleged shootout Eugene Radam, 34, former member of the Philippine Marines, and two of his companions, Diosdado Lim alias Dado, 39, resident of Marikina City, and Rodolfo Patinio alias Bullet, 34, married and residing in Bi-an, Laguna. It is not true that they were silenced. Let's take it from the pronouncement of the Cavite PPO, said Bataoil.
Previous to this, Ong said the killing of the three suspected kidnappers is to silence them in order to spare some people involved in the murder of Cervantes.
It was denied by Cavite PPO chief S/Supt. Samuel Pagdilao Jr., in a radio interview, that what happened was a rubout. The three suspected kidnappers were killed after their latest victim, one Jose Penano, identified their hideout in the said area.
Bataoil added that they did not know that these were also involved in the Cervantes murder. When they arrived there, they were bent more on arresting kidnap-for-ransom targets. As it turned out, the suspects were also involved in the Cervantes murder case.
The operatives also recovered the P2-million ransom paid by the Penano family to the suspects in exchange for his release.
4 Indonesian terrorists, charged
The Bureau of Immigration (BI) charged with the appropriate case four suspected Indonesian terrorists caught by soldiers, police and immigration agents in General Santos on Saturday.
Immigration Commissioner Andrea Domingo said yesterday that the four, identified as Uskar Makawata, Jaka Antarani, Rahman Lebahari and Julkri Lentembuba, will undergo deportation proceedings for being undocumented aliens.
The Indonesians were presented to the media by Domingo, Intelligence Group Director Jaime Karingal and Air Force Intelligence chief Col. Francisco Cruz at the BI building yesterday where the suspects are currently detained.
However, Domingo clarified that the Indonesians will not be immediately deported because they will be investigated and possibly charged with a criminal case in court because of their involvement in terrorism.
She said the foreigners will only be deported when these are sentenced and have served their sentence in jail.
According to Karingal, it is Makawata so far who will surely be charged in court because of his involvement in the Fitmart bombing in General Santos on April 21 where 15 people died and 63 were wounded.

Peanut eaters, not allowed to kiss
by
Jeffrey Kabiling
Do you have an allergy to peanuts? Therefore, avoid kissing persons who are fond of eating peanuts.
This was discovered by the scientists in "New England Journal of Medicine" based on their research conducted among those with allergy to peanuts and other types of grains.
According to them, kissing is a form of transmission when peanuts are the cause of allergic reaction.
Included among the symptoms of allergy are having itchy rashes, eczema and vomiting.
If the case of allergy is not given immediate attention, this may lead to a fatal Anaphylaxis that gives difficulty in breathing brought about by asthma, swelling of the throat or sudden decrease in blood pressure.
An allergy to peanuts is one of the causes for this kind of illness, according to their analysis.
The scientists analyzed their database of 379 patients who have allergy to peanuts and other grains where they discovered that there were 20 cases who had allergic reaction after they kissed.
One of the cases registered in the database was a patient involved in kissing the cheek of a three-year old child. Due to the intensity of allergic reaction, the patient had to be rushed in the emergency room.
The food allergy is an abnormal reaction to food based on the immune system of a person. The cases of allergy are usually coming from food traces of allergen like egg, peanuts, or eggplant.
SAF-RISSO, Mla police, near showdown
An operation done by the joint elements of the National Capital Regional Police Special Action Force (SAF) and Regional Intelligence Special Operation office (RISSO) almost lost control when one Manila police was shot because of the confusion in Tondo, Manila.
In a few tense minutes, it seemed that a showdown was inevitable between the SAF and RISSO operatives against the members of the Manila Police Stations 1 and 2 after SPO4 Alfredo Vitan of WPD Trafficom sent an SOS to his colleagues.
Vitan was shot by SAF-RISSO elements when he questioned them for pointing the gun at his 26 year old nephew Rizaldy Vitan. He was with the barangay chairman of the place when he was confronted by the police team. But according to Alfredo, he was shot and disarmed.
Alfredo was taken to the nearby Mary Johnston Hospital and was being guarded. Alfredo even stated that he was forced to alert his colleagues when an attempt was made to get him out of the hospital. The tension further escalated when more policemen came.

True hero
AS the saying goes, a person's true colors come out in times of need. It's natural for Filipinos to help others especially if the person who needs help is on the brink of death.
This is the story of two fishermen who were incidentally at sea with their the two sons of one of them when they witnessed the plane Fokker Flight 585 of Laoag Inter-national Airli-nes crash into the sea by Manila Bay the other week.
According to Edgar and Crispulo Naga, they quickly approached and pulled a few of the survivors out of the plane before the plane was fully submerged. This includes three women whom they took to Baclaran to get medical attention. A few of the 16 who survived the tragedy were the ones saved by the fishermen.
After assisting, they quickly sailed away from the crash in fear that the plane would explode and damage their boats.
Because of this, President Macapagal-Arroyo honored the two fishermen and the two teenage sons of one of them and called them "heroes of the people."
The President gave P50,000 to each of the brothers Edgar and Crispulo Naga as thanks for their actions. The two fishermen were with Elorde Naga, 12, son of Edgar, and Rico Cayabyab, 15, Edgar's adopted child, who helped them save the passengers of the plane that crashed.
Edgar mentioned that the money was the President's early Christmas gift, and he would use it so Edgar and Rico, who are both out of school, could get an education.
In interviews with reporters, Elorde mentioned that he would like to be a policeman to put kidnappers to justice.
Meanwhile, Crispulo Naga also plans to use the money given to him for his children's education.

Earthquake in Ecuador death count already 272
PEDERNALES, Ecuador (AP) – The rescue operations are still on-going after the strongest earthquake, in many decades, hit Ecuador, which flattened buildings and destroyed roads in Pacific coast.
The officials said yesterday that the death count has reached 272 and 1,557 more were injured.
The magnitude-7.8 quake that happened last Saturday, the biggest to hit Ecuador since 1979, has centered in the low-population fishing ports and tourist beaches of Ecuador, around 170 kilometers away from the north-western part of Quito, the country's capital.
Vice President Jorge Glas reported the number of deaths with a heavy heart in a news conference, while President Rafael Correa went back from Rome to manage the crisis.
22 dead from cholera outbreak
BANGUI (AP) — Twelve people died from a cholera outbreak in the Central African Republic this August.
Fernande Ndjengbot, Minister of Health and Public Hygiene, said this Thursday that 19 cases were recorded, and eight of them died where cholera first broke out in Ndjoukou, 300 kilometers southeast of Bangui.
The U.N. Children’s Agency assisted in water purification in order to secure safe drinking water for the people and so did other non-governmental organizations.
Cholera is a gastrointestinal disease that typically spread through contaminated water and food.
It may cause excessive diarrhea which in severe cases may lead to severe dehydration and kidney failure which can lead to death in a matter of a few hours.
BEST TO BE READY FOR THE ‘BIG ONE’
THE Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) denied the reports this weekend that the agency warns against a great earthquake in Metro Manila and nearby towns between February 24 and March 28. This is the dreaded “Big One” which is expected to shake the places covered by the “West Valley Fault.”
The surfacing of news about the possibility of a strong quake is probably due to the series of tremors with power starting at 6.7 magnitude which wasted Surigao del Norte last February 10, where eight people died and 200 others were wounded.
That is the greatest earthquake the place has experienced for the past one hundred years.
Phivolcs was able to record a total of 244 aftershocks after the magnitude 6.7 earthquake in Surigao del Norte.
Consecutive earthquakes with the power of 4.1 up to 4.9 magnitude were felt in different areas of Caraga, Davao, and Soccksargen, which intensified the fears of the residents.
Last Sunday, about two weeks after the huge quake in Surigao, Phivolcs reported a strong earthquake that caused huge waves with its magnitude 5.0 power in the Pacific, about 123 kilometers east of Burgos, Surigao del Norte.
That is why it is not at all surprising that, after the great quake in Surigao followed by others in the surrounding areas, there is concern with the “Big One” which has been anticipated for so long shaking Metro Manila.
It was June last year when “Shake Drill” was conducted, thousands of people participated in earthquake drills in Metro Manila and the neighboring towns of Bulacan, Cavite, Rizal, and Laguna.
The places mentioned are located over the West Valley Fault right now.
The Fault is believed to move every 400 years.
The last tremor caused by the Fault's movement happened in 1658, or 357 years ago, which is why there's a possibility for the dreaded “Big One” to happen anytime now.
Last week, Phivolcs denied that the agency warned against a great earthquake between February 24 and March 28. The agency emphasized that there's no actual way to know when an earthquake would occur.
This would suddenly happen when rock parts unrelentingly moving rubbed against each other too much.
Anytime now, this dreaded phenomenon may happen while it reaches its 400th anniversary since the West Valley Fault's last movement in 1658. This is the reason why the country conducts yearly shake drills, to avoid the many deaths that an earquake 7.2 magnitude strong in Metro Manila may cause.
There's a possibility that the death count would reach 34,000, according to Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)'s study, and about 100,000 more would be injured due to the collapse of buildings and structures.
Phivolcs has no actual warning for the days between February 24 and March 28 specific for the “Big One,” but it is only best that we ready ourselves for it.
We should know what to do during and after the calamity, what to prepare at all times, like food and emergency medical kits, where to go to get medical help, and others.
We're almost at the 400th year since 1658 when the West Valley Fault last moved which resulted to a great earthquake, and the next occurence may happen anytime now.
MISFIRE AGAIN IN MARAWI
For the second time, another bomb from the airstrike launched by the military failed, which resulted to the death of two soldiers and injuries of 11 others yesterday at noon time in Marawi City.
It was around 12:00 at noon time when the military launched a bomb from the air asset in which the target was the local ISIS, but it missed by almost 250 meters that's why the bomb landed on the area where the troops of the government were hiding.
According to Marine Col. Edgard Arevalo, AFP public information chief, people of the Philippine Army (PA) are the ones operating in that part of Marawi when the airstrike failed.
“Misfire happened when the bomb dropped hit the area of the government's troops,’ stated by Arevalo.
It was said that because of the strong explosion, some infrastructures collapsed.
Two large debris from the crushed concrete building accidentally hit the two soldiers which resulted to their death.
On the other hand, 11 were wounded from the shrapnels that hit them, who are currently recuperating in a hospital that was not named.
Also, according to Arevalo, as of now, the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) has formed a group who will perform a case investigation on the said incident.
It can be recalled that on June 1, 11 soldiers also died, while seven were wounded in a ‘friendly fire’ in Marawi.

Officials in Los Angeles mull ways to accommodate Katrina evacuees
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 6
County and city officials in Los Angeles tried to determine Tuesday how best to accommodate at least 2,000 evacuees expected to be brought from the Gulf Coast in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa assembled key members of their respective administrations over the Labor Day weekend to assess how the city and county could host thousands of displaced families that survived the disastrous hurricane, officials said.
Molina and Villaraigosa committed to taking at least 2,000 evacuees.
Local officials earlier announced the creation of a Los Angeles city-county Katrina Evacuees Task Force to assist survivors with immediate and long-term transitional assistance.
Local efforts will be coordinated with the California State Office of Emergency Services, the federal government, city and county departments and non-profit organizations such as the American Red Cross.
The mayor and county supervisor jointly activated the Los Angeles County Emergency Operation Center to prepare for the intensive response involved in assisting the evacuees.
Dozens of people have already traveled from the ruins of Louisiana and Alabama to Los Angeles County and are being sheltered at the Dream Center, a non-profit agency.
The newly formed task force is preparing to assist with shelter, supportive services, information and coordination of private sector assistance with the goal of finding evacuees more permanent housing as soon as possible.
Molina and Villaraigosa called on the private sector as well as nonprofit organizations to help them provide for the needs of the children and families that are coming to the Los Angeles area.
An investigation is under way into a fatal airliner accident in Mexico last night.
It happened as the DC-9 was trying to land during a rainstorm.
The Aero Mexico jet skidded off a runway and into a neighborhood in the town of Reynosa, about 50 miles from Brownsville, Texas.
Four people on the ground were killed.
But the 83 people aboard the plane escaped with only scrapes and bruises.
Libyan leader Colonel Gadaffi can be prosecuted in France over the bombing of a French airliner in which a 170 people were killed.
That's the ruling of a court in Paris.
It rejected an appeal that as a serving head of state Gadaffi should be immune from prosecution.
The lawyer representing the victims' families Francoise Rudetski is hailing the decision as a victory.
The victory today is that any people who committed an act of terrorism should know that he can be pursued and could be arrested and there is no immunity for anyone, any leaders in the world.
Relatives of those killed after an explosion on board the plane over Niger in 1989, brought the case against the Libyan leader.
Six Libyans including Colonel Gadaffi's brother-in-law have already been tried in their absence.
Ivory Coast's army has pledged its loyalty to opposition candidate Loran Gbagbo.
The pledge followed a tumultuous 24 hours that ended the rule of the junta, which seized power last December.
Soldiers and civilians took to the streets to celebrate the departure of junta leader General Robert Guei.
In an address on state television, Wednesday, Mr. Gbagbo, leader of the Ivorian Socialist party, said he would be forming a cabinet shortly.
Seven dead, 98 injured in east China tornado
HEFEI, July 4
Seven people were confirmed dead and 98 others were injured in a tornado that hit an east China city on Tuesday, say disaster relief authorities.
The bodies of seven people, including three from Renhe Township and four from Qinlan Township, were found in the debris of collapsed buildings, the provincial disaster relief office said in a press release on Wednesday.
All the injured villagers were being treated in local hospitals.
Of the ten seriously injured people, one is in critical condition, according to doctors.
Officials are still calculating the damage to Tianchang City, in east China's Anhui Province, where a tornado packing winds of 100 kilometers per hour destroyed more than 100 homes and forced the evacuation of at least 1,100 people in three villages.
Vice provincial governor Zhao Shucong led a relief team to Tianchang Wednesday morning, promising relief funds, materials and medical assistance.
Many Chinese provinces have reported disastrous weather in recent weeks, when flooding hit central and southern China while droughts persisted in the north.
By Monday, floods had caused 233 deaths and destroyed 118,500 houses in 18 areas, while droughts in the north had left nearly 7.4 million people short of drinking water, the state flood and drought prevention headquarters said.

Suspected terrorist, arrested by BI
by William B. Depasupil
ARRESTED by authorities was a foreigner suspected to be a Jordanian and member of the Islamic group Hamas, related to the bombing last week which killed an American soldier and two persons, according to a military official.
We took him into custody for violating our immigration laws. As for his alleged terrorist links. I'm leaving that to our military and police authorities to investigate, stated by Immigration Commissioner Andrea Domingo. According also to Domingo, Mohammad Amin S. Al-Ghaffari, 36, was arrested in Greenhills Shopping Center in San Juan because he has no legal documents and not because he was involved in Zambo bombing and related to al-Qaida terrorist group.
According to confidential documents gathered by Kabayan, Al Ghaffari is a director of Islamic Wisdom Worldwide Mission Inc., at 2nd Flr. Abater Apt., 323 Globo de Oro St., Quiapo, Manila.
According also to the documents, he is related to Mohammad Jamal Khalifa, brother-in-law of international terrorist Osama bin Laden, founder of al-Qaida network.
Killed were US Army Sgt. Mark Wayne Jackson and two Filipinos while 23 persons were injured in the bomb attack in an open-air market outside the military camp near Zamboanga on Wednesday.
According to reports, US Federal Bureau of Investigation and Philippine military pointed out that the Jordanian is not involved in the bombing.
They said he is connected with the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas, in Mindanao, a rebel group being linked by Washington to al-Qaida network.
Last July, the Philippines and the US conducted joint military exercises which aimed to train Filipino soldiers in stopping the Abu Sayyaf.
Jackson is a member of the small number of elite force of US Special Forces troops that were left behind in Mindanao to complete some development projects there.

Bali blast, 150 dead
BALI, Indonesia-More than 150 persons, mostly tourists, died in the bombing last Saturday night in the middle of the resort island of Bali and many bodies are still being looked for in the ruins yesterday.
The simultaneous bombings happened in the middle of the worries in the most populated Muslim country after the terror threats and Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said that "terrorism was most likely to blame."
"There are 150 dead," said Sanga Hospital communications chief Dr. Puta Putra Wisade to Reuters in the telephone. When asked how many are non-Indonesians, he said that: "Seventy-five percent are foreigners." He said that the injured have already reached 210.
Two bombs exploded in a populated main Kuta Beach tourist area, where there are clubs and bars. But the explosion that caused the biggest damage is the car bomb in front of the popular Sari nightclub, according to the US Embassy spokeswoman.
Windows were blown out in buildings within a 500-yard radius of the club and wrecked up to 15 cars. The smell of burned flesh hung in the air, according to official. One bomb exploded in Sanurm near the US honorary consulate.
Included among those who died are nationals from Australia, Britain, France, Germany, New Zealand and Sweden and the Indonesia's police chief said that the terrorists were the one responsible for this.
"If you look at the number of victims, this was indiscriminate and there is indeed a possibility this was terrorism," said police chief Dai Bachtiar to reporters in Jakarta's airport before he left going to Bali.
"It does look as though a terrorist organization was involved," stated by Australia's Downer to ABC television. "And secondly, it clearly looks as though this attack has been coordinated, and it clearly looks like an attack against foreign interests."

Prayer for Emmanuel
by
MER LAYSON
From the Emergency Room, the unusual fish-like child of the couple Jaime and Marilou Dormetorio, who they named Emmanuel, meaning "God is with us," has been transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of the East Avenue Medical Center.
The couple believes that the Lord will heed their prayer for them to spend a longer time with their baby who was born on Monday in their home. The five siblings also could not believe the way their youngest brother looks because all of them are normal and healthy. Their wish is for their new born brother to get well soon. Many have already read about and expressed desire to help baby Emmanuel. (Additional report on page 2.)
In publications in Manila Times and Kabayan and some news item on television, Baby Boy Dormetorio is now like a popular artist whom doctors, nurses and medical intern students want to see in the said hospital. Each one who takes a look at Baby "Fish boy" has a different reaction.
Some are shocked, some are scared, and some feel pity for the boy. Dr. Angelo Maulcon said he was shocked when he saw the child's tragic situation of difficulty breathing and unusual look compared to children rushed to the said hospital.
"His condition is Genetics, it is not the fault of the baby or his parents," said Dr. Maulcon. According to medical intern Daisy Soriano when she saw the unusual look of Baby Boy she felt slightly horrified and prayed for his safety. Eventually she was amused because children like him are unusual.
We still cannot state the true condition of the child because his situation is erratic and he needs to stay in the incubator, explains Dr. Lorenzo.
Argentina: “I Don't Believe in Schools but I do Believe in Education”
Educación Viva (Live Education) has released the first of their videos challenging traditional education systems, titled I Don't Believe in Schools but I do Believe in Education.
In the subtitled video, more than 20 men and women read aloud a poem on the educational system and how it is different from what they believe education is.
What happens if I tell you that knowing is not necessarily understanding?
That knowledge is important, but just absorbing information makes us more ignorant.
Understanding is having lived it and experienced it.
Knowing is just being able to accumulate it.
Education allows us to grow and develop, Schools to pass exams and graduate as slaves.
With their campaign, they are trying to get more people to send in their own video responses of the poem.
The poem should be clearly understood and they suggest using the same music released under Creative Commons for their videos.

Idiot who became rich
written by
Jeffery Kabiling
INSTEAD of being laughed at for his stupidity in driving his new motor home, a man received more than a million dollar as reward based on the decision the jury had for his case.
Mery Grazinski of Oklahoma City sued the company of the motor home he bought after he had an accident due to his stupidity in driving the said car.
He allowed the motor home to run by itself while he was busy making coffee inside the cabin of his automobile.
He has just bought his new 32-foot Winnebago motor home when he tried to run it on the street. "I was excited to try the motor home on the highway, so I immediately drove it after I received the delivery of the Winniebago," ang wika ni Grazinski sa Ingles.
Because of the said automobile has an auto-cruise control or automatic driving mechanism, he set it to a 70 miles-per-hour speed.
This is when he thought of going inside his motor home to make coffee. "I got thirsty, so I first got something to drink from the cabin of my automobile.
But as bad luck would have it, his automobile went over the highway and crashed into a tree. This was said to be the reason why Grazinski paid a few dollars for medical expenses after he was hospitalized for his stupidity.
The complainant won in court when it was proven by his lawyer that it was not written in the motor home hand book that the automobile should not be left running without the attention of the driver.
FOREIGNERS, TO BE RELEASED
Woman, killed by Chechen rebels
The guerilla attack on the Russian capital was made by 40 armed men and women demanding for the Russian troop withdrawal from their country. This evoked condemnation from leaders of many countries embarrassing the Kremlin.
The Russian security forces cannot do a thing since the guerillas were armed with guns and bombs, and threatened to bomb the theater along with the 700 hostages should they be attacked. But they promised to release the foreign hostages, a senior security official told the Russian media. Seven hostages were released yesterday, according to the spokesman of the FSB domestic security service of Russia.
Two women were successful in escaping through the windows while the gunmen were busy negotiating with the Russian and Chechen officials.
NTV television has aired yesterday the pictures of the guerillas, showing three men wearing camouflage uniforms and one woman, whose face was covered with a black headscarf with Arabic words written on it.

Tens of Thousands Demand Justice for Typhoon Haiyan Victims in the Philippines
“Global Surge” protest in Tacloban City, the “Ground Zero” of super typhoon Haiyan.

A series of protests themed “Global Surge” was organized across the Philippines and several cities around the world to commemorate the first year anniversary of super typhoon Haiyan (local name Yolanda), and to condemn the government’s “criminal negligence and corruption” in the aftermath of the disaster.
Haiyan was the strongest typhoon to make landfall in world history.
Victims, their families, and supporters labeled Philippine President Benigno Simeon Aquino III “waray pulos” or incompetent for his administration’s alleged poor performance in handling the disaster relief, rehabilitation, and recovery efforts.
Over 20,000 people joined the protest march in Tacloban City while another 20,000 people protested in Roxas City, Estancia, Kalibo, Iloilo City and other parts of Panay Island which are some of the areas hardest hit by Haiyan.
Some disaster survivors and their supporters also marched to the door steps of the Malacanang presidential palace in Mendiola while Filipino communities and solidarity groups organized various gatherings in the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, and across Europe.
The protesters criticized the Aquino government for allegedly aggravating the destruction brought about by Haiyan through the absence of a sustained relief and rehabilitation program, the reported misuse of calamity funds by politicians and relief agencies, and the profit-oriented feature of the rebuilding plans.
Groups such as the People Surge, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, Tindog Network, International League of People's Struggles, and Kalikasan People's Network for the Environment initiated the formation of Daluyong, a national network of disaster survivors.
They also used the hashtag #RememberHaiyan during the protest actions.
Activists also chided President Aquino for not visiting the Haiyan survivors in Tacloban where more than 2,000 died during the typhoon.
Renato Reyes, one of the protesters, asked on Facebook :
Why is Aquino skipping Tacloban on the first anniversary of Yolanda/Haiyan?
Is it because of the protesters that will be gathering in the city starting tomorrow?
Official government data puts the number of deaths at 6,300 and the number of missing at 1,061, but independent estimates by People Surge and Civil Society groups puts the number of fatalities at over 18,000.
A statistical analysis by independent think tank Ibon Foundation revealed that the accomplishments enumerated by the Aquino government are drastically below the targets it made earlier.
The Aquino government's Comprehensive Rehabilitation and Recovery Plan was signed only on October 29, 2014, almost a year after the calamity.

Protesters in Estancia town meanwhile decried the continuing delay of compensation for residents affected by the oil spill caused by the running aground of a power barge at the height of typhoon Haiyan.
Many residents filed a class suit against the company that owned the barge and other government agencies.
The oil spill caused the evacuation of more than 2,000 residents from their communities, which were contaminated by poisonous fumes.

Political analyst Benjie Oliveros wrote on alternative news website Bulatlat that the rehabilitation efforts are being hampered by massive corruption and wrong government priorities:
How could the people “build back better” when they have no land on which to build their houses?
How could the people acquire sustainable livelihood when those engaged in agriculture do not own the land they till and those who eke out a living through other means would be constantly displaced and thrown to remote areas where there are no livelihood opportunities?
Investigative journalist Kenneth Guda visited Tacloban and interviewed some of the survivors.
He wrote on Facebook :
They cry every time they retell their stories.
And not just because they lost loved ones and what little properties they had during the storm.
They cry every time they talk about how their children starved during the first few weeks after the storm.
They cry today because they could not move on.
[...] They cry because they are thankful for whatever help individuals and groups are able to give them, but they cry in anger at a government that promises help but always fails them.
An open letter from typhoon Haiyan survivors to Pope Francis has also been widely circulated online in relation to the pope's upcoming visit in January next year.
The letter laments how Haiyan victims continue to suffer from hunger, disease and government neglect.
According to “global surge” organizers, they will inform Francis about the real situation of Haiyan survivors during the his visit to Tacloban in January 2015.
